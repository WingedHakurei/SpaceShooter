# SpaceShooter

## Introduction

A configuration-driven STG framework based on Unity and xLua. The gameplay (e.g., fighters and waves) can be configured by lua scripts. 

Extra functionalities can be scripted by lua with the provided event structure and called by in-game C# actions.

The idea of gameplay configurations and event scripts are inspired by Red Alert 2 and Paradox Interactive games.
